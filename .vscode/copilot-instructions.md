# Flask Development Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
You are working on a Flask project that can be either:
1. **Flask Web Application** - A complete web application using Flask
2. **Flask Extension** - A reusable Flask extension for the Flask ecosystem

Generate code that follows Flask best practices, modern Python conventions, secure development patterns, and appropriate patterns for the project type.

**IMPORTANT: Always ask for explicit permission before creating, modifying, or deleting any files. Never perform any file operations without user consent.**

### Project Type Detection
**Always ask the user to clarify the project type if unclear:**
- "Are we building a Flask web application or a Flask extension?"
- "Should this follow Flask application patterns or Flask extension patterns?"
- "Is this intended to be distributed as a reusable Flask extension?"

## AI Collaboration Safety System

### Loop Detection and Circuit Breakers

**MANDATORY: Monitor collaboration patterns to prevent infinite loops and excessive iteration:**

#### Iteration Tracking
- **Track attempt count** for each specific problem or task
- **Maximum 3 attempts** for the same approach before triggering circuit breaker
- **Count total interactions** per session (reset daily)
- **Session limit**: 50 interactions before requiring break

#### Circuit Breaker Triggers
**Activate when any of these conditions occur:**

1. **Repetitive Failure Pattern**: Same error/approach fails 3+ times
2. **Excessive Iteration**: More than 5 back-and-forth cycles on single issue
3. **No Progress Indicator**: No measurable progress after 30 minutes
4. **Complexity Escalation**: Problem keeps getting more complex instead of simpler
5. **Tool Loop**: Using same tool repeatedly without success (5+ times)

#### Automatic Responses When Circuit Breaker Activates
**MANDATORY actions when circuit breaker triggers:**

```
ðŸš¨ CIRCUIT BREAKER ACTIVATED ðŸš¨

Problem: [Brief description of stuck pattern]
Attempts made: [Number of attempts]
Time spent: [Approximate duration]

STOPPING current approach. Initiating problem decomposition protocol.
```

### Problem Decomposition Protocol

**When circuit breaker activates, ALWAYS follow this protocol:**

#### Step 1: Problem Analysis Reset
- **Stop current approach immediately**
- **Summarize what has been attempted**
- **Identify specific blocking points**
- **List assumptions that may be incorrect**

#### Step 2: Decomposition Strategy
```
DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS:
1. Core Problem: [Single sentence problem statement]
2. Sub-problems identified: [List 3-5 smaller problems]
3. Dependencies: [What depends on what]
4. Minimum Viable Solution: [Simplest possible working version]
5. Alternative Approaches: [2-3 completely different methods]
```

#### Step 3: Collaborative Decision Point
**Present options to user:**
- **Option A**: Continue with simplified approach
- **Option B**: Switch to alternative method
- **Option C**: Take a break and return later
- **Option D**: Seek additional information or clarification

### Progress Validation Checkpoints

**MANDATORY: Validate progress at regular intervals:**

#### Every 3 Interactions
- **Summarize progress made**
- **Confirm we're moving toward solution**
- **Check if approach is still valid**
- **Ask user for feedback on direction**

#### Every 15 Minutes
- **Time check**: "We've been working on this for [X] minutes"
- **Progress assessment**: "Here's what we've accomplished..."
- **Path validation**: "Should we continue this approach or pivot?"

#### Before Major Changes
- **Impact assessment**: Files/systems that will be affected
- **Rollback plan**: How to undo if approach fails
- **Success criteria**: How we'll know it worked
- **Alternative plan**: What to try if this doesn't work

### Escalation Protocols

**When problems persist despite safety measures:**

#### Level 1: Approach Reset (After 3 failed attempts)
- Switch to completely different implementation approach
- Research alternative solutions or patterns
- Consult documentation or external resources
- Break problem into smaller, independent pieces

#### Level 2: Scope Reduction (After 6 failed attempts)
- Implement minimal viable solution first
- Remove non-essential features temporarily
- Focus on single core functionality
- Plan incremental improvements later

#### Level 3: Expert Consultation (After 9 failed attempts)
- Recommend consulting documentation, Stack Overflow, or community resources
- Suggest pair programming with human developer
- Propose research phase before continuing implementation
- Consider if problem requires domain-specific expertise

#### Level 4: Session Pause (After 12 failed attempts)
- **Mandatory break**: Stop all implementation work
- **Document current state**: What was attempted, what failed
- **Create resumption plan**: Steps for when work resumes
- **Recommend timeline**: Suggest minimum break duration

### Self-Monitoring Guidelines

**CONTINUOUS: Monitor these indicators during collaboration:**

#### Red Flags (Stop Immediately)
- Repeating same suggestion after it failed
- Increasing complexity instead of simplifying
- Making assumptions without verification
- Ignoring user feedback or constraints
- Generating code without understanding requirements

#### Yellow Flags (Slow Down and Reassess)
- Multiple tool calls with same parameters
- Long responses without clear progress
- Technical jargon without user confirmation
- Skipping workflow steps due to "efficiency"
- Solutions that seem too complex for the problem

#### Green Flags (Healthy Collaboration)
- Clear progress toward defined goals
- User engagement and feedback
- Incremental improvements and validation
- Appropriate tool usage and workflow adherence
- Solutions that match problem complexity

### Prevention Strategies

**PROACTIVE: Implement these to prevent loops before they start:**

#### Clear Communication
- **Always confirm understanding** before implementation
- **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are vague
- **Provide multiple options** instead of single solutions
- **Explain trade-offs** of different approaches

#### Structured Problem Solving
- **Break complex requests** into smaller tasks
- **Validate each step** before proceeding to next
- **Test incrementally** rather than implementing everything at once
- **Document decisions** and reasoning for future reference

#### User Engagement
- **Regular check-ins** during long implementations
- **Progress updates** every few interactions
- **Explicit approval requests** before major changes
- **Feedback solicitation** on approach and progress

## Development Workflow Process

### Required Workflow for All Code Changes

**MANDATORY: Follow this exact workflow for every development request:**

1. **Git Status Check**: Before making any changes, verify there are no pending git commits
   - Check `git status` to ensure working directory is clean
   - If there are uncommitted changes, stop and ask user to commit or stash them first
   - Never proceed with new work when there are pending changes

2. **Analysis and Suggestions**: Analyze the request and provide focused options (MAX 10 minutes)
   - Break down the request into specific tasks and components
   - **Limit to 2-3 approaches maximum** - more options create decision paralysis
   - **Start with simplest viable approach** - complexity can be added later if needed
   - Explain trade-offs, security implications, and architectural considerations
   - Provide estimated scope of changes (files affected, complexity level)
   - Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear
   - **Decision criteria**: If analysis exceeds 10 minutes or 3 back-and-forth exchanges, present best option and proceed with approval request

3. **User Approval**: Wait for explicit approval before implementation (MAX 5 minutes)
   - Present the proposed plan clearly with all affected files listed
   - **Default to simplest approach if no preference specified**
   - Get confirmation on the chosen approach
   - Confirm any architectural decisions or new dependencies
   - **Auto-proceed rule**: If user doesn't respond within 5 minutes and approach is low-risk, proceed with simplest option
   - Only proceed after receiving clear "yes" or "approved" from user

4. **Implementation**: Perform the approved changes
   - Create or modify files as planned
   - Follow all coding standards and security requirements outlined in these instructions
   - Include comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Add detailed docstrings and comments

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Create or update tests for all changes
   - Write unit tests for new functions and classes
   - Create integration tests for new routes or workflows
   - Include edge cases and error scenarios in tests
   - Test ALL occurrences of modified functionality throughout the project
   - Ensure test coverage remains above 90%
   - Run tests to verify they pass before proceeding

6. **Cleanup and Verification**: Clean up workspace and verify completion
   - Remove temporary files and development artifacts
   - Clear test database and reset test state
   - Verify all tests still pass after cleanup
   - Close database connections and release resources
   - Reset development environment to clean state
   - Clear any cached data or temporary configurations
   - Validate that application still runs correctly in clean state

7. **Documentation Updates**: Update all relevant documentation
   - Update API documentation for new or modified endpoints
   - Modify README.md if setup or usage instructions change
   - Update DEVELOPMENT.md for new development procedures
   - Add entries to CHANGELOG.md describing all changes
   - Update any affected configuration documentation
   - **Save Copilot interactions to knowledge base**:
     - Add successful interaction patterns to `docs/copilot/INTERACTIONS.md`
     - Record effective prompts and templates in `docs/copilot/PROMPTS.md`
     - Document insights and lessons learned in `docs/copilot/LESSONS.md`
     - Update decision patterns and frameworks in `docs/copilot/DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - Include session details in CHANGELOG.md Copilot sessions section

8. **Git Commit**: Create a proper git commit
   - Stage all modified files including tests and documentation
   - Write descriptive commit message following conventional commits format
   - Include summary of changes, files affected, and any breaking changes
   - Commit all changes as a single logical unit
   - Provide summary of completed work and next steps

### Workflow Enforcement

- **NEVER skip any step** in this workflow
- **ALWAYS check git status** before starting new work
- **ALWAYS wait for approval** before implementation
- **ALWAYS include comprehensive tests** for every change
- **ALWAYS update documentation** to reflect changes
- **ALWAYS commit changes** with descriptive messages

### Analysis Paralysis Prevention

**MANDATORY: Apply these rules to prevent decision delays:**

#### Time-Boxing Rules
- **Analysis Phase**: Maximum 10 minutes per request
- **Option Generation**: Maximum 3 approaches per decision point  
- **Approval Wait**: Maximum 5 minutes before defaulting to simplest approach
- **Research**: Maximum 15 minutes before presenting findings and proceeding

#### Decision Hierarchy (When Multiple Options Exist)
1. **Simplest working solution** (preferred default)
2. **Established pattern** from existing codebase
3. **Industry standard** approach
4. **Custom solution** (only if 1-3 are insufficient)

#### Quick Decision Triggers
- **Low-risk changes**: Proceed with best judgment if no user response in 5 minutes
- **Standard patterns**: Use established codebase patterns without extensive analysis
- **Maintenance tasks**: Default to existing code style and patterns
- **Testing**: Follow existing test patterns and structures

#### Complexity Escalation Rules
- Start with minimal viable implementation
- Add complexity only when simple solution proves insufficient
- Document why complexity was necessary
- Always provide rollback plan for complex changes

#### Circuit Breaker Activation
Automatically activate circuit breaker when:
- Same problem attempted 3+ times without success
- Analysis phase exceeds 15 minutes
- User requests become increasingly complex without clear requirements
- Implementation attempts result in repeated failures

### Flask Extension Development Patterns

#### Extension Class Pattern
```python
from flask import Flask, current_app

class FlaskExtensionName:
    def __init__(self, app=None):
        self.app = app
        if app is not None:
            self.init_app(app)
    
    def init_app(self, app: Flask):
        """Initialize extension with Flask application."""
        app.config.setdefault('EXTENSION_CONFIG_KEY', 'default_value')
        
        # Store extension instance on app
        app.extensions['extension_name'] = self
        
        # Register blueprints, error handlers, etc.
        if hasattr(app, 'teardown_appcontext'):
            app.teardown_appcontext(self.teardown)
```

#### Extension State Management
- Store configuration in `app.config` with prefixed keys
- Use `app.extensions` dict to store extension instances

## Security Requirements

### Always Implement
- CSRF protection using Flask-WTF
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention with SQLAlchemy ORM
- XSS prevention (Jinja2 autoescaping)
- Secure session configuration
- Environment variables for secrets

### Session Security
- Set SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True in production
- Set SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
- Set SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'

## Database Guidelines

### SQLAlchemy Models
- Use descriptive model names and relationships
- Include created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Use proper foreign key constraints
- Include __repr__ methods for debugging
- Use Flask-Migrate for schema changes

### Database Operations
- Always use database transactions appropriately
- Include proper error handling for database operations
- Use db.session.rollback() in error handlers

## Testing Requirements

### Test Organization
- Structure tests in unit/, integration/, functional/ directories
- Use conftest.py for shared fixtures
- Name tests descriptively: test_[unit]_[scenario]_[expected_result]
- Group related tests in classes

### Pytest Best Practices
- Use appropriate fixture scopes (session, module, function)
- Create factory fixtures for test data
- Use parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies properly
- Use test markers for categorization (slow, integration, etc.)
- Maintain test coverage above 90%

### Flask Testing Patterns
- Create separate test application with testing configuration
- Use clean database sessions for each test
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Include authentication fixtures for API tests
- Test template rendering and context variables

### Database Testing Safety
- **NEVER use production database for testing**
- Use separate test database (SQLite in-memory or dedicated test DB)
- Configure test database URL in testing configuration
- Use database transactions that rollback after each test
- Create fresh database schema for each test session
- Drop all test data after test completion

### Test Database Configuration
- Use in-memory SQLite for fast, isolated tests: `sqlite:///:memory:`
- Alternative: separate test database with naming convention (e.g., `myapp_test.db`)
- Set `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` to test database in testing config
- Never use environment variables that point to production database
- Use database name suffixes like `_test` to clearly identify test databases

### Production Database Protection
- Use database backup strategies before any testing that might touch production
- Implement database connection verification in test setup
- Use separate database user with limited permissions for testing
- Add assertion checks to verify test database connection
- Use database URL validation to prevent accidental production access
- Implement database migration rollback procedures for development testing

## Error Handling

### Custom Error Pages
- Create custom error handlers for common HTTP errors
- Include database rollback in 500 error handlers
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Log errors appropriately

### Logging
- Configure rotating file handlers for production
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Include structured logging with timestamps and context

- Include proper meta tags and viewport
- Use url_for() for static files and routes
- Include flash message handling
- Use CSRF tokens in forms
- Follow semantic HTML structure

## Development Workflow

### Environment Setup
- Always use virtual environments
- Keep requirements.txt updated
- Use .env for local development
- Never commit sensitive data
- Use .gitignore for Python projects

### Quality Assurance
- Write tests for all routes and business logic
- Run linting and formatting tools
- Test migrations before applying to production
- Document API endpoints and complex logic
