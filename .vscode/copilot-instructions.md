# Flask Development Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
You are working on a Flask web application. Generate code that follows Flask best practices, modern Python conventions, and secure development patterns.

**IMPORTANT: Always ask for explicit permission before creating, modifying, or deleting any files. Never perform any file operations without user consent.**

## AI Collaboration Safety System

### Loop Detection and Circuit Breakers

**MANDATORY: Monitor collaboration patterns to prevent infinite loops and excessive iteration:**

#### Iteration Tracking
- **Track attempt count** for each specific problem or task
- **Maximum 3 attempts** for the same approach before triggering circuit breaker
- **Count total interactions** per session (reset daily)
- **Session limit**: 50 interactions before requiring break

#### Circuit Breaker Triggers
**Activate when any of these conditions occur:**

1. **Repetitive Failure Pattern**: Same error/approach fails 3+ times
2. **Excessive Iteration**: More than 5 back-and-forth cycles on single issue
3. **No Progress Indicator**: No measurable progress after 30 minutes
4. **Complexity Escalation**: Problem keeps getting more complex instead of simpler
5. **Tool Loop**: Using same tool repeatedly without success (5+ times)

#### Automatic Responses When Circuit Breaker Activates
**MANDATORY actions when circuit breaker triggers:**

```
ðŸš¨ CIRCUIT BREAKER ACTIVATED ðŸš¨

Problem: [Brief description of stuck pattern]
Attempts made: [Number of attempts]
Time spent: [Approximate duration]

STOPPING current approach. Initiating problem decomposition protocol.
```

### Problem Decomposition Protocol

**When circuit breaker activates, ALWAYS follow this protocol:**

#### Step 1: Problem Analysis Reset
- **Stop current approach immediately**
- **Summarize what has been attempted**
- **Identify specific blocking points**
- **List assumptions that may be incorrect**

#### Step 2: Decomposition Strategy
```
DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS:
1. Core Problem: [Single sentence problem statement]
2. Sub-problems identified: [List 3-5 smaller problems]
3. Dependencies: [What depends on what]
4. Minimum Viable Solution: [Simplest possible working version]
5. Alternative Approaches: [2-3 completely different methods]
```

#### Step 3: Collaborative Decision Point
**Present options to user:**
- **Option A**: Continue with simplified approach
- **Option B**: Switch to alternative method
- **Option C**: Take a break and return later
- **Option D**: Seek additional information or clarification

### Progress Validation Checkpoints

**MANDATORY: Validate progress at regular intervals:**

#### Every 3 Interactions
- **Summarize progress made**
- **Confirm we're moving toward solution**
- **Check if approach is still valid**
- **Ask user for feedback on direction**

#### Every 15 Minutes
- **Time check**: "We've been working on this for [X] minutes"
- **Progress assessment**: "Here's what we've accomplished..."
- **Path validation**: "Should we continue this approach or pivot?"

#### Before Major Changes
- **Impact assessment**: Files/systems that will be affected
- **Rollback plan**: How to undo if approach fails
- **Success criteria**: How we'll know it worked
- **Alternative plan**: What to try if this doesn't work

### Escalation Protocols

**When problems persist despite safety measures:**

#### Level 1: Approach Reset (After 3 failed attempts)
- Switch to completely different implementation approach
- Research alternative solutions or patterns
- Consult documentation or external resources
- Break problem into smaller, independent pieces

#### Level 2: Scope Reduction (After 6 failed attempts)
- Implement minimal viable solution first
- Remove non-essential features temporarily
- Focus on single core functionality
- Plan incremental improvements later

#### Level 3: Expert Consultation (After 9 failed attempts)
- Recommend consulting documentation, Stack Overflow, or community resources
- Suggest pair programming with human developer
- Propose research phase before continuing implementation
- Consider if problem requires domain-specific expertise

#### Level 4: Session Pause (After 12 failed attempts)
- **Mandatory break**: Stop all implementation work
- **Document current state**: What was attempted, what failed
- **Create resumption plan**: Steps for when work resumes
- **Recommend timeline**: Suggest minimum break duration

### Self-Monitoring Guidelines

**CONTINUOUS: Monitor these indicators during collaboration:**

#### Red Flags (Stop Immediately)
- Repeating same suggestion after it failed
- Increasing complexity instead of simplifying
- Making assumptions without verification
- Ignoring user feedback or constraints
- Generating code without understanding requirements

#### Yellow Flags (Slow Down and Reassess)
- Multiple tool calls with same parameters
- Long responses without clear progress
- Technical jargon without user confirmation
- Skipping workflow steps due to "efficiency"
- Solutions that seem too complex for the problem

#### Green Flags (Healthy Collaboration)
- Clear progress toward defined goals
- User engagement and feedback
- Incremental improvements and validation
- Appropriate tool usage and workflow adherence
- Solutions that match problem complexity

### Prevention Strategies

**PROACTIVE: Implement these to prevent loops before they start:**

#### Clear Communication
- **Always confirm understanding** before implementation
- **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are vague
- **Provide multiple options** instead of single solutions
- **Explain trade-offs** of different approaches

#### Structured Problem Solving
- **Break complex requests** into smaller tasks
- **Validate each step** before proceeding to next
- **Test incrementally** rather than implementing everything at once
- **Document decisions** and reasoning for future reference

#### User Engagement
- **Regular check-ins** during long implementations
- **Progress updates** every few interactions
- **Explicit approval requests** before major changes
- **Feedback solicitation** on approach and progress

## Development Workflow Process

### Required Workflow for All Code Changes

**MANDATORY: Follow this exact workflow for every development request:**

1. **Git Status Check**: Before making any changes, verify there are no pending git commits
   - Check `git status` to ensure working directory is clean
   - If there are uncommitted changes, stop and ask user to commit or stash them first
   - Never proceed with new work when there are pending changes

2. **Analysis and Suggestions**: Analyze the request and provide options
   - Break down the request into specific tasks and components
   - Suggest multiple implementation approaches when applicable
   - Explain trade-offs, security implications, and architectural considerations
   - Provide estimated scope of changes (files affected, complexity level)
   - Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear

3. **User Approval**: Wait for explicit approval before implementation
   - Present the proposed plan clearly with all affected files listed
   - Get confirmation on the chosen approach
   - Confirm any architectural decisions or new dependencies
   - Only proceed after receiving clear "yes" or "approved" from user

4. **Implementation**: Perform the approved changes
   - Create or modify files as planned

   - Include edge cases and error scenarios in tests
   - Test ALL occurrences of modified functionality throughout the project
   - Ensure test coverage remains above 90%
   - Run tests to verify they pass before proceeding

6. **Cleanup and Verification**: Clean up workspace and verify completion
   - Remove temporary files and development artifacts
   - Clear test database and reset test state
   - Verify all tests still pass after cleanup
   - Close database connections and release resources
   - Reset development environment to clean state
