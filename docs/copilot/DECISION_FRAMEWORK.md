# Quick Decision Framework for Copilot Collaboration

## Overview
This framework provides clear decision-making guidance to prevent analysis paralysis while maintaining code quality.

## Decision Speed Guidelines

### Immediate Decisions (< 2 minutes)
Use these patterns without extensive analysis:

#### Code Style & Formatting
- Follow existing file patterns
- Use established naming conventions
- Match current indentation and structure

#### Standard Operations
- CRUD operations → Use existing model patterns
- API endpoints → Follow current routing structure
- Database queries → Use established ORM patterns
- Error handling → Match existing error patterns

#### Testing
- Unit tests → Follow existing test file structure
- Integration tests → Use current testing patterns
- Fixtures → Match existing fixture patterns

### Quick Decisions (< 5 minutes)
Simple analysis required:

#### Library Choices
- **First choice**: Use libraries already in requirements
- **Second choice**: Well-established Flask ecosystem libraries
- **Avoid**: New or experimental libraries without clear justification

#### Architecture Patterns
- **First choice**: Extend existing patterns in codebase
- **Second choice**: Standard Flask patterns (Blueprints, Application Factory)
- **Avoid**: Custom architecture without clear need

#### Configuration Changes
- **First choice**: Extend existing config structure
- **Second choice**: Follow Flask configuration best practices
- **Avoid**: Complex configuration systems

### Standard Decisions (< 10 minutes)
Moderate analysis for significant changes:

#### New Features
- Break into smallest possible components
- Identify which existing patterns can be reused
- Choose established Flask patterns over custom solutions
- Consider security and performance impact

#### Database Changes
- Prefer migrations over manual schema changes  
- Use existing model patterns and relationships
- Consider data integrity and backup requirements

#### API Design
- Follow existing API structure and conventions
- Use established status codes and response formats
- Consider versioning only if absolutely necessary

## Decision Trees

### Authentication Implementation
```
Need Authentication?
├── Simple login/logout → Flask-Login (Standard)
├── API token auth → Flask-JWT-Extended (Standard)  
├── OAuth integration → Authlib (Established)
└── Complex requirements → Research phase (10 min max)
```

### Database Operations
```
Database Operation?
├── Basic CRUD → Use existing model patterns (Immediate)
├── Complex queries → SQLAlchemy ORM (Quick)
├── Performance critical → Consider raw SQL (Standard)
└── Migration needed → Alembic (Standard)
```

### Testing Strategy
```
What to Test?
├── New function → Unit test (Immediate)
├── New route → Integration test (Quick)
├── New feature → Both unit + integration (Standard)
└── Bug fix → Reproduce bug + fix test (Standard)
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Analysis Paralysis Triggers
❌ **Don't do this**:
- Generating 5+ implementation options
- Spending >15 minutes on architectural decisions
- Over-engineering simple requirements
- Researching multiple libraries for standard tasks
- Creating custom solutions for solved problems

✅ **Do this instead**:
- Present 2-3 clear options with recommendation
- Set 10-minute timer for analysis phase
- Start with simplest working solution
- Use established Flask ecosystem tools
- Extend existing patterns when possible

### Decision Loops
❌ **Avoid these patterns**:
- Constantly asking "What approach should we use?"
- Reopening decided architectural questions
- Switching implementation mid-development
- Seeking perfect solution before starting

✅ **Better patterns**:
- Make decision with current information
- Document decision rationale
- Implement and iterate based on results
- Refactor when requirements become clearer

## Emergency Decision Protocol

When stuck in analysis paralysis:

### Step 1: Reset (2 minutes)
- Stop current analysis
- State the core problem in one sentence
- Identify the simplest solution that could work

### Step 2: Default Choice (3 minutes)
- Choose the most standard/established approach
- Document why this is a reasonable default
- Proceed with implementation

### Step 3: Iterate Later
- Implement the default solution
- Gather feedback and real-world usage
- Refactor based on actual needs, not theoretical concerns

## Success Metrics

### Good Decision-Making Velocity
- ✅ Analysis phase: 5-10 minutes average
- ✅ Implementation starts within 15 minutes of request
- ✅ Working solution delivered within 30 minutes for simple tasks
- ✅ Complex features broken into deliverable chunks

### Warning Signs
- ⚠️ Analysis phase exceeding 15 minutes
- ⚠️ Multiple option generation without clear recommendation
- ⚠️ Repeated architecture discussions for same component
- ⚠️ Implementation not starting within 20 minutes

Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of good. Ship working solutions and iterate.**
