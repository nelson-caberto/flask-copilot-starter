# Flask Copilot Starter Documentation

## Overview
This is a Flask web application starter template optimized for development with GitHub Copilot. The project follows Flask best practices and includes comprehensive documentation.

## 🚀 **Quick Start** (< 10 minutes)

### 1. **Fork & Clone** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Fork on GitHub → Clone your fork → Navigate to project
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flask-copilot-starter.git
cd flask-copilot-starter
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/flask-copilot-starter.git
```

### 2. **Setup VS Code + Copilot** (3 minutes)
```bash
# Open in VS Code
code .

# Install extensions (if not already installed):
# - GitHub Copilot
# - GitHub Copilot Chat
# - Python (recommended)
```

### 3. **Configure AI Model** (2 minutes)
**⚠️ CRITICAL**: AI models don't auto-read project guidelines. Use this prompt:

```
Before we start, please read these files to understand this project:

1. Read `.vscode/copilot-instructions.md` - Contains the complete development guidelines, safety protocols, and mandatory 8-step workflow for this Flask project.

2. Read all files in `docs/` directory - Understand project structure, documentation standards, and what needs updating when making changes.

After reading, please confirm: "I have read the project guidelines and commit to following all instructions, workflows, and safety protocols."

Once confirmed, we can begin development.
```

### 4. **First Development Task** (3 minutes)
```
I want to create a basic Flask application following this project's patterns.

Please use the 8-step workflow:
1. Check git status
2. Analyze requirements (max 5 minutes)
3. Get my approval for approach
4. Implement with Flask-Migrate if database changes
5. Create comprehensive tests
6. Clean up workspace
7. Update documentation
8. Git commit

Start now - use the simplest Flask patterns and don't overthink it.
```

## ⚡ **Ready to Code?** Jump to [Development Guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md)

#### Open Project in VS Code
```bash
# From the project directory
code .
```

#### Verify Custom Instructions
1. **Check that `.vscode/copilot-instructions.md` exists** in your workspace
2. **VS Code will automatically use these instructions** for this project
3. **Test the setup** by asking Copilot: "What are the coding standards for this Flask project?"

#### ⚠️ Important Note: Copilot Instructions Loading
**AI models (including Copilot) do NOT automatically read or load the `.vscode/copilot-instructions.md` file.** You must explicitly instruct them to read and understand the project's guidelines.

**Use this prompt template to ensure AI models read the project guidelines:**

```
Before we start working together, please read the following files to understand this project's development guidelines:

1. Read `.vscode/copilot-instructions.md` - This contains the complete development guidelines, safety protocols, and mandatory 8-step workflow for this Flask project.

2. Read all files in the `docs/` directory to understand the project structure, documentation standards, and what needs to be documented when making changes.

After reading these files, please confirm you understand and commit to following:
- The mandatory 8-step development workflow (never skip any steps)
- The safety protocols and circuit breakers 
- That you must ask permission before creating/modifying files
- The Flask coding standards and patterns to follow
- All testing and documentation requirements

Please explicitly state: "I have read the project guidelines and commit to following all instructions, workflows, and safety protocols outlined in the files."

Once you've made this commitment, we can begin development work.
```

**Why This Is Necessary:**
- AI models cannot automatically access project files unless explicitly instructed
- The Copilot instructions contain critical safety protocols and workflows
- Following the documented patterns ensures consistent, high-quality results
- The 8-step workflow prevents common development issues and maintains code quality

#### Enable Copilot Features
- **Inline suggestions**: Type code and press `Tab` to accept suggestions
- **Chat interface**: Use `@workspace` to ask about project-specific questions
- **Code generation**: Reference the instruction file for best practices

### 4. First Steps with Copilot

#### Test Your Setup
1. **Open a new file** in the project
2. **Type a comment**: `# Create a Flask route for user registration`
3. **Press Enter** and see if Copilot suggests Flask code
4. **Ask Copilot**: "Show me the project structure and explain the safety features"

#### Set Up Development Environment with Copilot
Once Copilot is working, ask it to help set up your development environment:

**Prompt to use with Copilot:**
```
I need to set up the development environment for this Flask project using Pipenv. 

Please help me:
1. Create a Pipfile with the core Flask dependencies listed in the project documentation
2. Set up the virtual environment using Pipenv
3. Install development dependencies for testing and code quality
4. Create a basic .env template file
5. Verify the setup is working correctly

Follow the project's 8-step workflow and ask for permission before creating any files.
```

**Expected Copilot Response:**
Copilot will analyze the project structure, review the dependency requirements from the documentation, and guide you through creating:
- `Pipfile` with production dependencies (Flask, Flask-WTF, Flask-SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- Development dependencies (pytest, black, flake8, coverage)
- `.env` template with required environment variables
- Instructions for activating the virtual environment

#### Start Development
1. **Read the safety protocols**: Check `.vscode/copilot-instructions.md`
2. **Review examples**: Browse `docs/copilot/INTERACTIONS.md`
3. **Use templates**: Reference `docs/copilot/PROMPTS.md` for effective prompts
4. **Check decision guides**: Review `docs/copilot/DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md` for quick decisions
5. **Follow workflow**: Always use the 8-step development process

#### First Development Task Example
Try this prompt with Copilot to test the full workflow:
```
I want to create a basic Flask application structure following this project's patterns.

Please:
1. Analyze the project requirements from the documentation
2. Suggest the implementation approach
3. Create the basic app structure with Application Factory pattern
4. Include proper error handling and logging
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

Remember to follow the 8-step workflow and ask for permission before making changes.
```
