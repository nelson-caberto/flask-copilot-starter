# Flask Copilot Starter Documentation

## Overview
This is a Flask web application starter template optimized for development with GitHub Copilot. The project follows Flask best practices and includes comprehensive documentation.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

#### Fork on GitHub
1. **Navigate to the repository** on GitHub
2. **Click the "Fork" button** in the top-right corner
3. **Select your account** as the destination for the fork
4. **Wait for GitHub** to create your personal copy

#### Clone Your Fork
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flask-copilot-starter.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd flask-copilot-starter

# Add the original repository as upstream (for future updates)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/flask-copilot-starter.git
```

### 2. Set Up VS Code with GitHub Copilot

#### Install Required Extensions
1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Install GitHub Copilot extension**:
   - Open Extensions panel (`Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS)
   - Search for "GitHub Copilot"
   - Click "Install" on the official GitHub Copilot extension
   - Click "Install" on "GitHub Copilot Chat" as well

#### Authenticate GitHub Copilot
1. **Sign in to GitHub**:
   - Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Type "GitHub Copilot: Sign In"
   - Follow the authentication flow
   - Authorize VS Code to access your GitHub account

#### Verify Copilot is Active
1. **Check status bar**: Look for Copilot icon in bottom-right corner
2. **Test completion**: Create a new file and start typing Python code
3. **Check chat**: Open Copilot Chat panel (`Cmd+Shift+I`)

### 3. Configure Copilot for This Project

#### Open Project in VS Code
```bash
# From the project directory
code .
```

#### Verify Custom Instructions
1. **Check that `.vscode/copilot-instructions.md` exists** in your workspace
2. **VS Code will automatically use these instructions** for this project
3. **Test the setup** by asking Copilot: "What are the coding standards for this Flask project?"

#### Enable Copilot Features
- **Inline suggestions**: Type code and press `Tab` to accept suggestions
- **Chat interface**: Use `@workspace` to ask about project-specific questions
- **Code generation**: Reference the instruction file for best practices

### 4. First Steps with Copilot

#### Test Your Setup
1. **Open a new file** in the project
2. **Type a comment**: `# Create a Flask route for user registration`
3. **Press Enter** and see if Copilot suggests Flask code
4. **Ask Copilot**: "Show me the project structure and explain the safety features"

#### Set Up Development Environment with Copilot
Once Copilot is working, ask it to help set up your development environment:

**Prompt to use with Copilot:**
```
I need to set up the development environment for this Flask project using Pipenv. 

Please help me:
1. Create a Pipfile with the core Flask dependencies listed in the project documentation
2. Set up the virtual environment using Pipenv
3. Install development dependencies for testing and code quality
4. Create a basic .env template file
5. Verify the setup is working correctly

Follow the project's 8-step workflow and ask for permission before creating any files.
```

**Expected Copilot Response:**
Copilot will analyze the project structure, review the dependency requirements from the documentation, and guide you through creating:
- `Pipfile` with production dependencies (Flask, Flask-WTF, Flask-SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- Development dependencies (pytest, black, flake8, coverage)
- `.env` template with required environment variables
- Instructions for activating the virtual environment

#### Start Development
1. **Read the safety protocols**: Check `.vscode/copilot-instructions.md`
2. **Review examples**: Browse `docs/copilot/INTERACTIONS.md`
3. **Use templates**: Reference `docs/copilot/PROMPTS.md` for effective prompts
4. **Follow workflow**: Always use the 8-step development process

#### First Development Task Example
Try this prompt with Copilot to test the full workflow:
```
I want to create a basic Flask application structure following this project's patterns.

Please:
1. Analyze the project requirements from the documentation
2. Suggest the implementation approach
3. Create the basic app structure with Application Factory pattern
4. Include proper error handling and logging
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

Remember to follow the 8-step workflow and ask for permission before making changes.
```
